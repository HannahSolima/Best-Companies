# Companies
*In SQL Server, I created three small and simple tables about a few (fake) companies and its employees. This is to practice using SQL Server syntax, writing and creating functions as well as constructing and executing stored procedures. I primarily utilize this project as a way to refer back to the basics when necessary.* 

# ************************************************************************

#### Question 1
Create a stored procedure that you pass a CompanyID, and it returns the Full Names (LAST, FIRST) of persons in that company and if they are a current employee. 

Test your MyEmployeesSP stored procedure by passing CompanyIDs 14, 5 and 6.

***

#### Question 2
The company, Cole and Company, is shutting down in 6 months. 


Which employee spent the longest time with the company?

You want the top 3 oldest and top 3 youngest workers in the same table. 


What is the difference in years between the youngest and oldest worker?

#### Question 5
Which business type is most prevalent? Most profitable?

All the home cities are US state capital cities.

Which region (NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST) do most persons reside? 

Does there appear to be any pattern with the region of persons and working for a non-American company?

#### Question 7
Pretend you are a recruiter looking for someone with IT skills. Create a stored procedure called ITWorkers that pulls out the name of the persons who have “Analyst” or “Engineer” in the role column and the company for which they previously worked or currently work.

Update the stored procedure ITWorkers to also include whether the person is a remote worker and whether the role was Full-Time or Part-Time in the Result-Set.
